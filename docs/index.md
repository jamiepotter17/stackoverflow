# Introduction

What's next in the world of tech? If you're looking for your first job in a technology-related field, or looking to advance in your field, you likely somewhere in the region of have 0.5 of an eye to one full Sauron trained on anticipating trends in tech.

Everyone has advice to impart, but only with data do we have the possibility of wisdom. To this end, it pays to examine data gathered by Stack Overflow, which carries out an annual self-report survey on its userbase. It has been doing so since 2011, and publishes its data [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/). They ask novel and creative questions each year (turns out more people like Star Wars than Star Trek, which is absolutely fine by me, not a problem, not bothered in the slightest, some people have no taste, whatever), but there are some common threads that can be pulled out over time in order to discern some possible trends as we move into 2022 and beyond.

Here is what I've found after investigating in detail the data for 2016 to 2021 inclusive:

# Will There Still Be Space For the Little Guy?

With representations of technology in the news and popular culture, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was the preserve of awkward, other-worldly tech gurus at the head of vast corporations - Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg. Should we, then, be preparing ourselves for having to work under the likes of Mark Rylance's Peter Isherwell in *Don't Look Up*?

Or is there still some space for the little guy? How are small to medium-size enterprises faring, and is there any evidence from the Stack Overflow developer data that things are moving towards big tech eclipsing everything?

Well, assuming that changes in the Stack Overflow responses will be mirrored in the larger tech community, at least the anglophone community, things appear to have been fairly stable in terms of the size of company respondents work for:

![Organisation Size](./orgsize.png)

The most common category in terms of organisation size is the medium-size enterprise (20-99 employees), and this remains the case throughout the time period in question, with approximately 22% of respondents (of those who answered this question) selecting that category in any given year. And small businesses remain hale and hearty throughout the period, with over 20% of respondents in companies of under 20 employees in every year, and no obvious trend over the period. So good news, people: if you don't want to work for Peter Isherwell, you probably won't have to!
