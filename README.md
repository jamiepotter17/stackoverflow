## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Code in the Jupyter Notebook file 'CRISP-DM Process.ipynb' should run on a standard Anaconda distribution of Python 3.*.

However, it ran without errors on this specific installation if a failsafe is needed:
python 3.6.13
jupyter 1.0.0
matplotlib 3.3.4
numpy 1.17.0
pandas 1.1.5

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. Information about this online course can be found [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). Specifically, it was the first project required.

For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow survey data longitudinally in order to evaluate:

1. What Size Organisation do People Work For and Has This Changed?
2. What Countries are Developers From?
3. What Programming Languages are Developers Using?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

* ./docs/ - contains files for the maintenance of the blog post, which is viewable at [https://jamiepotter17.github.io/stackoverflow/](https://jamiepotter17.github.io/stackoverflow/).
* .gitignore and ./.ipynb_checkpoints - github files.
* README.md - this file.
* CRISP-DM Process.ipynb - the Jupyter Notebook file used in the exploration and analysis of the Stack Overflow data.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings are summarised on the blog at [https://jamiepotter17.github.io/stackoverflow/](https://jamiepotter17.github.io/stackoverflow/).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Many thanks to Stack Overflow for collecting and publishing the data, which is available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/). Feel free to use this information and code as you will.
